# runescape-automation

## About
A for-fun project which will automate some basic runescape tasks. Though I am not a runescape player, I saw similar projects on YouTube which taught runescape players to code by automating some of their routine tasks (crudely botting for resources). Though it is likely that this type of automation will be detected by Runescape and result in an account/IP ban based on comments on the YouTube videos, it is an excellent way to stay engaged while learning or practicing implementation of coding concepts. 

## Plans
- Create a login system which switches worlds to 301, takes user input for email and passwords, and has an option to use default values based on environment variables **(done)**
- Create a utility which moves your mouse to a destination in a way which mimics a human's movements of a mouse
- Create a script which teleports your character to Lumbridge
- Create a script which checks inventory and banks if not empty
- Create a script which walks you to a tree patch
- Create a script which executes a resource gathering pattern and stops when full
- Create a script which banks resources
- Refactor to practice OOP, SOLID, DRY
- Refactor for implementation of a design pattern
