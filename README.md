# runescape-automation

## About
A for-fun project which will automate some basic runescape tasks. Though I am not a runescape player, I saw similar projects on YouTube which taught runescape players to code by automating some of their routine tasks (crudely botting for resources). Though it is likely that this type of automation will be detected by Runescape, it was still an excellent way to stay engaged while learning or practicing coding concepts.

## To Run
1. npm i
2. node index
